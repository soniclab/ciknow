1, checkout code from github (ciknow, ciknowclient, ciknowmgr)
2, make changes as needed
3, commit and push to github
4, the Jenkins server in sonicserver.northwestern.edu will get notified by github, 
   and start building ciknow deployment artifacts. 
   (There is a glitch here: the timestamp show in the ciknow manager application 
    will only be updated if the ciknowmgr project is updated. In order to get the
    updated timestamp, you can login to sonicserver.northwestern.edu/jenkins, and
    manually "build" the ciknowmgr project.)
5, in jenkins, click "build" for the "deploy2sonicserver" or "deploy2ciknow". This
   will deploy the new code base to sonicserver or production(ciknow) server.
